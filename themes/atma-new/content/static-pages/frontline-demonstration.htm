<p align="justify" style="text-align: justify;">Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) has undertaken the important mandates of KVK i.e. Front Line Demonstration especially on Oilseed and Pulses. Every year Krishi Vigyan Kendra conducts several demonstrations on farmers fields on technologies released by research institutes, universities. These are mainly related to latest released varieties, agronomic management of crops, methods to control pest &amp; diseases, technologies to increase yields, agri implements to reduce drudgery of women, technologies to reduce cost of production etc.,</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of Front-Line Demonstrations is to demonstrate newly released crop production and protection technologies and its management practices in the farmers’ field under different agro-climatic regions and farming situations. While demonstrating the technologies in the farmers’ field, the scientist to study the factors contributing higher crop production, field constraints of production and thereby generate production data and feedback information. Front-Line Demonstrations are conducted in a block of two or four hectares land in order to have better impact of the demonstrated technologies on the farmers and field level extension functionaries.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-align: justify;">FLDs provide an opportunity to researchers and extension personnel for understanding the farmer’s resources and requirement to fine tune and/or modify the technologies for easy adaptability at farmers’ fields.</p>
