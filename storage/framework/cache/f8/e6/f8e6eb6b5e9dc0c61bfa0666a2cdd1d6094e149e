<p style="text-align: justify;">Through On Farm Testing Krishi Vigyan Kendra does comparative studies in farmers’ fields to come to conclusion which of the technologies tested is more suitable to the resources available in the district &amp; is cost effective.<span>&nbsp;</span>This is a form of participatory study where farmers’ perspective is given most importance. The results of such studies can later be made available to farmers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Farm Testing is aimed at testing the proven technologies evolved at Research Stations on farmers’ field with their farming system perspective in view under their management and their active participation so as to convince them the relevance and viability of the new technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Agricultural Universities/ICAR institutes recommend different technologies on large scale. Due to variation in agro-climatic situations, soil types, few technologies may not perform to its potential and needs minor modifications at field level.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Krishi Vigyan Kendra is working at grass root level. The technologies, which may not perform are modified or fine tuned and tested on farmer’s field with usually three treatments for comparison. These technologies are tested for 2-3 subsequent years. The results are discussed with the scientists/researcher and finally the decision about continuation of refined practice is taken and implemented for mass adoption in the same area.</p>
