Gramonnati Mandal (Establishment: 1944)

The Gramonnati Mandal Institute of Narayangaon was founded by the late Guruvarya R P Sabnis. The institute has been a beacon of pioneering education in the northern region of Pune District, Maharashtra. Our great founder Guruvarya Sabnis was a prolific thinker, great orator and a passionate patriot. Being a visionary educationist he dedicated his life to uplift the rural area by binding it to education. His foresight recognized the need to have a multidimensional education system that would go hand in hand with the rural life. The majority of rural population being farmers, he associated agriculture with formal education and thus the Agricultural School of Narayangaon was conceived of his exceptional thought. Since then the Gramonnati Mandal has carried this beacon of education forward in the hope of providing a progressive and productive path to the people. Its students no doubt have become self reliant and proudly bear self esteem on their sleeves.
